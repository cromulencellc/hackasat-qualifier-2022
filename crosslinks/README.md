crosslinks
--------------


This repo contains all "crosslink" type challenges. They are all spacemath type challenges and all related in that they present intersatellite crosslink data based on the same basic package (in the crosslink folder)

Challenge 1
================
The links crossed challenge provides:

- TLE file for a full constellation of satellites
- Range between your satellite and others in view
- Range rate between your satellite and others in view

The player must solve:

- The satellite name

The challenge is repeated multiple times and is randomized to prevent brute force guessing.

Challenge 2
==============
The links crossed 2 challenge provides
- TLE only for a set of observed satellites
- A single range to each observed satellite
- A single range rate to each observed satellite

The player must solve:
- The position of the satellite
- The velocity of the satellite
