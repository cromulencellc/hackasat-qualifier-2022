# Quals Challenge: Authentication Equivalence Principle #

**Category:** ??
**Relative Difficulty:** 4/5
**Author:** [Cromulence](https://cromulence.com/)

We were so worried about this satellite that we made every contact begin with multi-factor authentication. We reset the keys and reset the synchronization but now we can't access the satellite. The only problem is the engineer who wrote our MFA app was part of the great resignation and now we cant figure out how to get back to communicate with our satellite. 

The engineer who did all the MFA stuff didn't believe in git. We found this executable and associated input file on his shared drive.
